# Workplace-Report-with-SQL-Queries
# Introduction
The modern work environment is rapidly evolving, with remote and hybrid work models becoming increasingly prevalent across industries. While this shift offers flexibility and improved work-life balance, it also raises concerns about increased stress, social isolation, and mental health challenges. Organizations must gain insight into these challenges to effectively support employee well-being and performance.
# Problem Statement
A global HR consultancy firm is seeking to understand how remote work affects employees' mental well-being. They have observed rising concerns around stress levels, social isolation, and job satisfaction among remote workers. However, they lack clear insights into the key factors driving these challenges, as well as their impact across different job roles, industries, and demographic groups. To support this initiative, I conducted an exploratory analysis using a dataset of 5,000 employees worldwide, which captures various aspects of their work environment, demographics, and mental health. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can guide HR decisions and improve remote work strategies.
# Objective
This analysis explores the relationship between remote work and employee mental well-being, using Power BI for interactive and data-driven insights.
The goals of this project are to:
- Provide a clear understanding of employee demographics, work arrangements, and mental health patterns
- Identify key factors influencing stress levels, job satisfaction, and social isolation
- Offer strategic recommendations to help organizations improve their remote work policies and foster a healthier, more supportive work environment
